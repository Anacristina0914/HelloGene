# Hello-World

This is me, Ana Cristina González.  I am trying to find my way into data science, and become a bioinformatician
I've just started a job in a Clinical Research Center, and little by little starting to immerse myself into
bioinformatics. 

The end.
:)

I have created a second branch. I want to test out how this is to work, when working in collaborative work.
